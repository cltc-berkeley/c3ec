## Executive Summary

This report is meant to help practitioners understand what to consider when developing a phishing policy and provide recommendations. We conducted a limited review of existing phishing research, but were unable to get feedback from existing practitioners or gain access to existing phishing policies due to time constraints. We would highly recommend incorporating those sources of information into future iterations.

## Introduction to Phishing

Phishing is on the rise in both severity and amount of attacks. According to the 2019 Data Breach Investigations Report conducted by Verizon, phishing is the top threat action used in 32% of all successful data breaches, with attacks involving social engineering and malware [1].

While there is a wide variety of how to do phishing guides, ranging from advocacy groups such as EFF to commercial products, available on the web, we were unable to find any publicly accessible phishing policies. We can draw some insights from research that has been conducted in the space of evaluating the effectiveness of phishing training as well as the CPHS IRB process as a framework for ethical considerations [2, 3].


### Existing Phishing Policies

We do not currently have examples of existing phishing policies. 

UC Berkeley has an Information Security and Policy group that reportedly has an existing phishing policy and does conduct phishing training for the university. We have reached out to [security@berkeley.edu](mailto:security@berkeley.edu), but have yet to receive a response.

Their resources can be found at:

[https://security.berkeley.edu/resources/phishing](https://security.berkeley.edu/resources/phishing)

And they have a phishing quiz that is currently in use:

[https://phishingquiz.withgoogle.com](https://phishingquiz.withgoogle.com/)

For conducting phishing training at UC Berkeley, one is supposed to contact [security@berkeley.edu](mailto:security@berkeley.edu) for questions and review of their procedures. 


### IRB for Phishing Policy

Though much of the IRB policies are more research specific, we can leverage its frameworks for thinking about how to protect the rights and welfare of human subjects. The section on Assessment of Risks and Benefits as laid out in the Belmont Report [4] on which ethical research guidelines are based is especially pertinent. 

The basic ethical principles the report asks us to follow are:



1. Respect for persons - individuals should be treated as autonomous agents and that persons with diminished autonomy (e.g. underserved populations) are entitled to protection
2. Beneficence - actions should (1) do not harm and (2) maximize possible benefits and minimize possible harms
3. Justice - consider who ought to receive the benefits and bear its burdens (this is more relevant for research, such as in choosing what population to involve)

Of the three, the most important in our assessment is the principle of beneficence in assessing the risk versus benefit of a good policy. The report uses the following definitions:



*   “Benefit” as non-probabilistic positive value related to health or welfare; this may include contribution to generalizable knowledge and direct benefit to participant(s)
*   “Risk” as possibility that harm may occur; including both chance (probability  of experiencing harm) and severity (magnitude of such harm)

We recommend when developing policies to have at least one author or reviewer having taken the Group 2 Human Subjects Training: Social and Behavioral Research Investigators Course, available to all UC Berkeley affiliates through CPHS and CITI, available at [https://cphs.berkeley.edu/training.html](https://cphs.berkeley.edu/training.html).

Relevant sections from the CPHS training are as follows:



*   Assessing risk and privacy
    *   Assessing Risk (ID 503)
    *   Informed Consent (ID 504)
    *   Privacy and Confidentiality (ID 505)
*   Given clinic work with vulnerable populations
    *   Vulnerable Subjects (ID 483)
    *   Unanticipated Problems and Reporting Requirements in Social and Behavioral Research (ID 14928)
*   Given work with groups in other nations
    *   Cultural Competence in Research (ID 15166)
    *   International Research (ID 509)


## Considerations for Constructing a Policy

When forming a phishing policy, we would recommend considering the following questions:



*   What benefits would your phishing training and simulation bring to your organization?
*   What is the goal of the phishing training or simulation? 
    *   For my organization? 
        *   To assess the risk of phishing to my organization
        *   To evaluate the effectiveness of phishing trainings (e.g. they do not click 1 week, 1 month, or 6 months in the future)
    *   For the participants?
        *   To introduce and inform participants about phishing
        *   To remind participants about phishing
*   When should participants be informed (e.g. ahead of time, 
*   What should be the size of my phishing training (e.g. select individuals, all individuals, by team, by department, across the organization)?
*   Where should training material be placed (e.g. in a live workshop ahead of time, in the phishing email, in training afterwards)?
*   When do you inform participants they may be sent
*   What emotional duress or stress might your training materials (emails or presentation) cause your participants?
*   How long should phishing simulations last?

A policy for a phishing simulation should include the following:



*   Goal of outcome
*   Target group definition
*   Set duration
*   Plan for disclosure to participants
    *   Ahead of time: consent getting, alert (potentially with opt out)
    *   Afterwards: debrief, share outcomes, additional training
*   Review of phishing materials that evaluates potential harms (e.g. emotional duress or stress) against actual benefits (for organization or participant)

If our goal is to conduct generalizable research, we should additionally consider:



*   Who should be included in the sample? Who should we exclude (e.g. undue burden)?
*   Can this take place in a lab or field setting?
*   What is my outcome variable?
*   Should I get informed consent ahead of time?
*   How should I debrief the participants?

Table 1, shown below, is from a 2018 CHI paper provides an overview of previous research design for phishing. Since they were interested in understanding how people who respond to different kinds of training material when shown after they have clicked on the phishing link, they did not get informed consent ahead of time. In this situation the debrief becomes very important as is having an IRB already in place [2].

Also interesting is that phishing studies [2, 3] referred to timeframes for phishing as short (2-days), medium (7-days) and long (30-days). Outcome variables refer to if the user clicked on the phishing link (click), if they shared personal information (info), or click and information (both).

Please note that any phishing done for generalizable research purposes would need to submit a protocol for IRB review. You can find more information at [https://cphs.berkeley.edu/](https://cphs.berkeley.edu/training.html).


## Limitations and Future Work

Due to time constraints, there is much more work that can be done, including but not limited to conducting expert interviews, getting existing phishing policies currently in practice, and getting feedback from practitioners and past phishing simulation participants

Further questions to consider:



*   Is the risk versus benefit assessment approach of the IRB a good approach to consider? Is there another framework that can be used?
*   How can we assess what is acceptable "harm" or "risk" in a phishing policy?
*   What are some normative constraints to consider (e.g. culture of organization, size of campaign, frequency of phishing attempts)?
*   Who are all of the stakeholders who should be considered with regard to a phishing policy (e.g. managers, employees, HR, legal team)?

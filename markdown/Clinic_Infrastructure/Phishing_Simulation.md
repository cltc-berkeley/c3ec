# **Setting up a Phishing Simulation**

## Introduction to Phishing

Phishing is on the rise in both severity and amount of attacks. According to the 2019 Data Breach Investigations Report conducted by Verizon, phishing is the top threat action used in 32% of all successful data breaches, with attacks involving social engineering and malware [1].

While there is a wide variety of how to do phishing guides, ranging from advocacy groups such as EFF to commercial products, available on the web, we were unable to find any publicly accessible phishing policies. We can draw some insights from research that has been conducted in the space of evaluating the effectiveness of phishing training as well as the CPHS IRB process as a framework for ethical considerations [2, 3].


## Citizen Clinic Phishing Policy


### Existing Phishing Policies


UC Berkeley has an Information Security and Policy group that reportedly has an existing phishing policy and does conduct phishing training for the university. We have reached out to [security@berkeley.edu](mailto:security@berkeley.edu), but have yet to receive a response.

Their resources can be found at:

[https://security.berkeley.edu/resources/phishing](https://security.berkeley.edu/resources/phishing)

And they have a phishing quiz that is currently in use:

[https://phishingquiz.withgoogle.com](https://phishingquiz.withgoogle.com/)

For conducting phishing training at UC Berkeley, one is supposed to contact [security@berkeley.edu](mailto:security@berkeley.edu) for questions and review of their procedures. 


### IRB for Phishing Policy

Though much of the IRB policies are more research specific, we can leverage its frameworks for thinking about how to protect the rights and welfare of human subjects. The section on Assessment of Risks and Benefits as laid out in the Belmont Report [4] on which ethical research guidelines are based is especially pertinent. 

The basic ethical principles the report asks us to follow are:

1. Respect for persons - individuals should be treated as autonomous agents and that persons with diminished autonomy (e.g. underserved populations) are entitled to protection
2. Beneficence - actions should (1) do not harm and (2) maximize possible benefits and minimize possible harms
3. Justice - consider who ought to receive the benefits and bear its burdens (this is more relevant for research, such as in choosing what population to involve)

Of the three, the most important in our assessment is the principle of beneficence in assessing the risk versus benefit of a good policy. The report uses the following definitions:

*   “Benefit” as non-probabilistic positive value related to health or welfare; this may include contribution to generalizable knowledge and direct benefit to participant(s)
*   “Risk” as possibility that harm may occur; including both chance (probability  of experiencing harm) and severity (magnitude of such harm)

We recommend when developing policies to have at least one author or reviewer having taken the Group 2 Human Subjects Training: Social and Behavioral Research Investigators Course, available to all UC Berkeley affiliates through CPHS and CITI, available at [https://cphs.berkeley.edu/training.html](https://cphs.berkeley.edu/training.html).

Relevant sections from the CPHS training are as follows:

*   Assessing risk and privacy
    *   Assessing Risk (ID 503)
    *   Informed Consent (ID 504)
    *   Privacy and Confidentiality (ID 505)
*   Given clinic work with vulnerable populations
    *   Vulnerable Subjects (ID 483)
    *   Unanticipated Problems and Reporting Requirements in Social and Behavioral Research (ID 14928)
*   Given work with groups in other nations
    *   Cultural Competence in Research (ID 15166)
    *   International Research (ID 509)


### Considerations for Constructing a Policy

When forming a phishing policy, we would recommend considering the following questions:

*   What benefits would your phishing training and simulation bring to your organization?
*   What is the goal of the phishing training or simulation? 
    *   For my organization? 
        *   To assess the risk of phishing to my organization
        *   To evaluate the effectiveness of phishing trainings (e.g. they do not click 1 week, 1 month, or 6 months in the future)
    *   For the participants?
        *   To introduce and inform participants about phishing
        *   To remind participants about phishing
*   When should participants be informed (e.g. ahead of time, 
*   What should be the size of my phishing training (e.g. select individuals, all individuals, by team, by department, across the organization)?
*   Where should training material be placed (e.g. in a live workshop ahead of time, in the phishing email, in training afterwards)?
*   When do you inform participants they may be sent
*   What emotional duress or stress might your training materials (emails or presentation) cause your participants?
*   How long should phishing simulations last?

A policy for a phishing simulation should include the following:

*   Goal of outcome
*   Target group definition
*   Set duration
*   Plan for disclosure to participants
    *   Ahead of time: consent getting, alert (potentially with opt out)
    *   Afterwards: debrief, share outcomes, additional training
*   Review of phishing materials that evaluates potential harms (e.g. emotional duress or stress) against actual benefits (for organization or participant)

If our goal is to conduct generalizable research, we should additionally consider:

*   Who should be included in the sample? Who should we exclude (e.g. undue burden)?
*   Can this take place in a lab or field setting?
*   What is my outcome variable?
*   Should I get informed consent ahead of time?
*   How should I debrief the participants?

Table 1, shown below, is from a 2018 CHI paper that provides an overview of previous research design for phishing. Since they were interested in understanding how people who respond to different kinds of training material when shown after they have clicked on the phishing link, they did not get informed consent ahead of time. In this situation, the debrief becomes very important as is having an IRB already in place [2].

![alt_text](../images/Phishing1.png "Various Phishing Designs")


Also interesting is that phishing studies [2, 3] referred to timeframes for phishing as short (2-days), medium (7-days) and long (30-days). Outcome variables refer to if the user clicked on the phishing link (click), if they shared personal information (info), or click and information (both).

Please note that any phishing done for generalizable research purposes would need to submit a protocol for IRB review. You can find more information at [https://cphs.berkeley.edu/](https://cphs.berkeley.edu/training.html).


### Limitations and Future Work

Due to time constraints, there is much more work that can be done, including but not limited to conducting expert interviews, getting existing phishing policies currently in practice, and getting feedback from practitioners and past phishing simulation participants

Further questions to consider:

*   Is the risk versus benefit assessment approach of the IRB a good approach to consider? Is there another framework that can be used?
*   How can we assess what is acceptable "harm" or "risk" in a phishing policy?
*   What are some normative constraints to consider (e.g. culture of organization, size of campaign, frequency of phishing attempts)?
*   Who are all of the stakeholders who should be considered with regard to a phishing policy (e.g. managers, employees, HR, legal team)?

## Sample End of Exercise Notification

Hi _NAME(S)_,

This notification is for your awareness that, as of _TIME_ today, _DATE_, the phishing attack simulation Citizen Clinic conducted for the _NAME OF ORG_ has concluded.

In my opinion, the results will successfully highlight practices to sustain and improve upon both at the individual and organizational level. There are some things that _NAME OF ORG_ did well and areas that _NAME OF ORG_ will need to improve upon to increase their digital security. We will compile a report of our findings to share with leadership in private and with _MODIFYasNEEDED_ as previously discussed.

We will discuss areas for improvement and procedures for recovery & response. Do advise participants that we took steps to mitigate risks such as no passwords being collected / stored and requesting account credentials for accounts that already have multi-factor authentication enabled or presumably would be "virtual identities." Any information sent to the two "attacker" accounts is also protected by strong authentication (Yubikeys). 

Security is a team effort so any information disclosed should not seem like personal failures, but a combination of weak links in a chain. When a participant realizes they did disclose information to us, they should also realize that their disclosure was part of a larger system where ultimately the odds (and human nature) are stacked up against them. Participants should not compare themselves with others - neither at the individual or organizational level. Instead, we seek improvement that is relative to the current state - the goal is that participants are themselves better prepared to handle similar threats today or tomorrow compared to where they were yesterday.

That being said: 

1) Participants should know that they will not be receiving any more simulated phishing emails from us via our attacker personas (_INSERT ATTACKER EMAILS_). It is possible that prior emails may be bumped in their inbox due to your email service's reminder feature. Any forms or "malicious" links have been disabled. Any messages sent to those accounts will not be returned.  

2) The two attacker persona accounts (_INSERT ATTACKER EMAILS_) have already been reported and confirmed. We will detail the attacks in our brief, but for participants' peace of mind, there is no need to take any immediate recovery steps, although changing one's password, reviewing sign-in activity, and ensuring multi-factor authentication is enabled can provide some relief to personal feelings of discomfort.

3) The _NAME OF ORG_ should resume their security and incident response policies & practices as usual. We're not in a posture to continually evaluate suspicious emails, but we're still, of course, happy to help as we can. _XYZ_ should, in most cases, be your primary resource beyond internal information sharing and precautions.

Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks for participating!

_Note: Additional confirmation of end of exercise to be sent via trusted channel (eg. Signal instead of email)_

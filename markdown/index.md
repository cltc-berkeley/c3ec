The Citizen Clinic is a public-interest cybersecurity clinic at the University of California, Berkeley. We support the capacity of politically vulnerable organizations to defend themselves against online threats. Building off the Center for Long-Term Cybersecurityâ€™s [research](https://cltc.berkeley.edu/defendingpvos/) on the ecosystem of organizations providing technical assistance to civil society, the clinic supports multidisciplinary teams of students to assess threats to targeted organizations, recommend risk-appropriate mitigations, and work collaboratively with clients to implement new policies and technical controls that enhance their cybersecurity. Visit this [page](Clinic_Curriculum/Case_Studies/) to read case studies about our recent work.

The **Citizen Clinic Cybersecurity Education Center** is designed to share basic cybersecurity resources for civil society organizations, and to inform other academic institutions that may be interested in adopting the clinic model.

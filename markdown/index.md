The Citizen Clinic is a public interest cybersecurity clinic at the University of California, Berkeley. We support the capacity of politically targeted organizations to defend themselves against online threats. Building off the Center for Long-Term Cybersecurityâ€™s [research](https://cltc.berkeley.edu/defendingpvos/) on the ecosystem of organizations providing technical assistance to civil society, the clinic supports multidisciplinary teams of students to assess threats to targeted organizations, recommend risk-appropriate mitigations, and work collaboratively with clients to implement new policies and technical controls that enhance their cybersecurity.
